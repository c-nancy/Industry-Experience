    <string name="last_paragraph">Above diagram shows the common items that has been exposed on Australian beach. Obviously, plastic forms a huge part of it. \nAccording to a research done by WWF Australia, 85% of Australian seabirds are affected by plastic pollution. Marine animals, like sea turtles, can choke on plastic bags mistaken for jellyfish. Seabirds can not recognise plastic debris too, they would swallow plastic pieces until their stomach is full and still starving.</string>
